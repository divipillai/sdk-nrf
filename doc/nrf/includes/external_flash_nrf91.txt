External flash
==============

To use the external flash memory on the nRF9160 DK v0.14.0 or later versions, you must program the board controller by completing the following steps:

#. Download the nRF9160 DK board controller firmware from the `nRF9160 DK downloads`_ page.
#. Make sure the **PROG/DEBUG SW10** switch on the nRF9160 DK is set to **nRF52**.
#. Program the board controller firmware (:file:`nrf9160_dk_board_controller_fw_2.0.1.hex`) using the `Programmer app <Programming a Development Kit_>`_ in nRF Connect for Desktop.

.. note::
   The board controller firmware version must be v2.0.1 or higher, which enables the pin routing to external flash.

See :ref:`nrf9160_ug_intro` for more details.
